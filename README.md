## Hi there 👋

I'm Mathilde, from Montpellier city in the south of France ☀️ 🏖️

💻 🛠 🎨 📈 Specialized in the optimization of web project interfaces with JS stack, I like to create modern and innovative solutions that fully meet users' needs, whether they are external or internal to the company.

### About me

👉 My professional background is as eclectic as it's rich in experience. During my 10 years of activity, I've constantly developed my interest in digital technology through the exercise of different functions in 3 fields:
- **scientific research** as a *historian*, *archaeologist* and *lecturer*, in French and English
- **the digital** as a *2D graphic designer*, *webmaster* and *community manager* for a cultural association
- **computer science** and **teaching** as a *university computer science tutorialist*

👉 Considering that you have to know how to question yourself, test new things and not be afraid to change path, it was therefore quite naturally in IT development that I decided to totally redirect my career in November 2019.

👉 🎓 So I’m currently learning fullstack JavaScript at the french full remote O'Clock school (https://oclock.io/): promo Nautilus.
It's an accelerated and intensive 6-month training in web development focused on JavaScript Frontend and Backend technologies.

I am constantly improving my skills and knowledge through curiosity, patience, listening and perseverance.
